    <Body> There is macaroni and cheese, and then there is special occasion macaroni and cheese like this one. Unlike most recipes, which start with a roux, this one begins with a milk-and-egg base, which gives the dish an incredibly rich, silky taste. This is a certified banger. </Body>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li> add Kosher Salt And Black Pepper </li>
        <li> 1 pound Elbow Macaroni </li>
        <li> 2 cups Whole Milk </li> 
        <li> 2 Large Eggs </li> 
        <li> 4 cups Extra-Sharp Cheddar (shredded, about 16 ounces) </li> 
        <li> ½ cup Unsalted Butter (1 stick, melted) </li>
        <li> 2 cups Colby Jack (shredded, about 8 ounces)  </li>

    </ul>

    <h4> Steps </h4>

    <ol> 
        <li> Make the béchamel sauce:
        Melt butter over medium heat in a saucepan. Add in the diced onion, flour, and seasonings and whisk until the roux is golden in color. Slowly whisk in the milk and cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for about five minutes or until the sauce has slightly thickened.
        </li>

        <li> Add in the cheese:
            Remove the saucepan from the stove, and stir in 3/4 cup of extra-sharp yellow Cheddar cheese and sharp white Cheddar until melted.
        </li>

        <li> Assemble and bake:
            Add in the cooked pasta and remaining cubed Cheddar cheeses. Stir to evenly combine and pour into a 13- x 9-inch baking dish. Bake according to instructions. Sprinkle reserved shredded cheese on top of the dish, and broil for another 2 minutes until melted and a crispy, golden-brown layer has formed on top.
        </li>

        <li> Bake on a rimmed baking sheet in preheated oven until bubbly and golden, 30 minutes. Remove from oven; increase oven temperature to broil. Sprinkle with reserved shredded cheeses; broil 6 inches from heat until cheeses are melted and golden, about 2 minutes. Remove from oven; cool slightly on a wire rack, about 15 minutes.
