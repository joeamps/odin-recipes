        Skip the restaurant and make your own copycat Chipotle Chicken recipe at home. The marinade is quick, easy, healthy, and tastes even better than the real thing! Make white meat or dark meat and follow my instructions for either baking or grilling. You no longer have to worry about the terrible chipotle portion sizes because the real deal is at your fingertips!

                Combine all the marinade ingredients in a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth, then transfer to a plastic bag or covered container.
                Add the chicken, mash around to distribute, and let marinade for 30 minutes.

                Here are your cooking options at home: Stove-top skillet (indoor, similar to Chipotle’s method), Gas grill (outdoor, minimal cleanup),
                Baked in the oven (cover with parchment paper for juicy chicken every time)
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice or dice and use for burritos, tacos, bowls, salads, everything!
